# **Java-Selenium-Cucumber-TestNG-API-Web-Automation-Framework**

This repository contains the development of a Java project using Restassured, Selenium, Cucumber, and using TesNG as TestRunner, to automate the testing of the Star Wars API and Wikipedia Webpage. The testing scenarios implemented include:

- Create a Scenario Outline to request the Star Wars API, get the name of the character, search for it on the Wikipedia web page, and make the needed assertions to check if the character page is displayed correctly.
- Create a scenario to request for a random movie using the Star Wars API, search for this movie on the Wikipedia web page, go to the article page and click on the Edit Link. Check the edit page is displayed correctly, including the matching of the title for the article page.
- Create a scenario to request for a random movie using the Star Wars API, search for this movie on the Wikipedia web page, go to the article page and click on the Ver Historial Link. Check the History page is displayed correctly, including the matching of the title for the article page.
